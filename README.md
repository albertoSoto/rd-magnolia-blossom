Full project with maven integration, profile for developing, Blossom module, Light module configuration and... Spring MVC with Rest support out of the box
Prepared for any company that search for a real professional template in magnolia CMS.

## Features
- Sets a servlet using Spring MVC configuration and changes behaviours for allowing controllers as rest points out of Magnolia Blossom 
- Uses Magnolia Blossom
- It's set up in the same module for possible mutual redundant logic dependency
- Exposes custom .json api
- Spring services
- Backoffice type component toolkit
- Disposes rd-magnolia-light module: (So it integrates all it's module!) Check docu at [github](https://github.com/albertoSoto/rd-magnolia-light)

- check uri ($yourserver)/api/spring/v1/dummy1/yuhu.json WORKS (That means that dispatcher spring rest servlet works)

IMPORTANT NOTE:
If your project is already installed you can have problems while setting dispatcher servlet (the default install process does not create the servlet via magnolia module configuration)
